                        <p>Yummyumm, chicken! 
                            Once upon a time there was a little chick called Chicken Licken who lived on a farmyard in the countryside.<br>
                            One day, Chicken Licken went to the woods. He stopped by an oak tree. Suddenly a tiny acorn dropped from
                            the tree – wheeeeeeeeee!<br> 
                            And hit Chicken Licken on the head – BONK!<br>
                            Unfortunately, Chicken Licken didn’t see the acorn. He looked up the clear blue sky.<br> 
                            “Oh, no!” he said “The sky is falling, I must tell the king.”<br>
                            So he ran and he ran and he ran until he got to the farmyard where he met Henny Penny.<br>
                            “What’s the hurry?” clucked Henny Penny.<br>
                            “The sky is falling and I’m off to tell the king” cried Chicken Licken<br>
                            “I’d better come too” clucked Henny Penny<br>
                            So Chicken Licken and Henny Penny scurried off to find the king.<br>
                            “What’s the hurry?” crowed Cocky Locky.<br>
                            “The sky is falling and I’m off to tell the king” cried Chicken Licken<br>
                            “I’d better come too” crowed Cocky Locky<br>
                            So Chicken Licken, Henny Penny and Cocky Locky scurried off to find the king.<br>
                            “What’s the hurry?” quacked Ducky Lucky and Drakey Lakey<br>
                            “The sky is falling and I’m off to tell the king” cried Chicken Licken<br>
                            “I’d better come too” quacked Ducky Lucky and Drakey Lakey<br>
                            So Chicken Licken, Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Ducky Lucky and Drakey Lakey scurried off to find the king.<br>
                            “What’s the hurry?” honked Goosey Loosey<br>
                            “The sky is falling and I’m off to tell the king” cried Chicken Licken<br>
                            “I’d better come too” honked Goosey Loosey<br>
                            So Chicken Licken, Henny Penny, Cocky Locky , Ducky Lucky, Drakey Lakey and Goosey Loosey scurried off to find the king.<br>
                            “What’s the hurry?” gobbled Turkey Lurkey<br>
                            “The sky is falling and I’m off to tell the king” cried Chicken Licken<br>
                            “I’d better come too” gobbled Turkey Lurkey<br>
                            So Chicken Licken, Henny Penny, Cocky Locky , Ducky Lucky, Drakey Lakey, Goosey Loosey and Turkey<br>
                            Lurky scurried off to find the king.<br>
                            “What’s the hurry?” snapped Foxy Loxy.<br>
                            “The sky is falling and I’m off to tell the king” cried Chicken Licken<br>
                            “Follow me, my feathery friends, I can help you find the king” smiled Foxy Loxy.<br>
                            So, Chicken Licken, Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Ducky Lucky, Draky Lakey, Goosey Loosey and Turkey Lurky followed Foxy Loxy deeper into the forest.<br>
                            Foxy Loxy was just getting ready to gobble up the feathery friends when suddenly a tiny acorn dropped from the tree – wheeeeeeeeee!<br> 
                            And hit Foxy Loxy on the head – BONK!<br>
                            Luckily, Foxy Loxy didn’t see the acorn. He looked up the clear blue sky. “Oh, no!” he said “The sky is falling, I must tell the king.”<br>
                            Foxy Loxy ran off and was never seen again. Everyone looked at Chicken Licken.<br>
                            “Are you sure the sky fell on your head” they said.<br>
                            “Well, maybe it was an acorn” said Chicken Licken!<br>
                            And they chased him all the way home to the farmyard.<br>

                    <h3 id="Beef">Beef</h3>
                    <p>From a cow. They say.
                            Once up a time there were three cows. Daddy cow (also known as a bull), Mummy cow and Baby cow. They lived in a field beside another field that was used as a car park. <br>
                            The cows did not do very much, all they did was eat grass and chew the cud. <br>
                            “I’m bored," Baby cow said one day. <br>
                            “Here the farmer has left the gate open," Mummy cow said. <br>
                            The three cows looked at each other. They could go into the next field that was full of cars. <br>
                            “Shhh," said Daddy cow (also known as a bull). “Let’s go in and see what’s what. There’s nobody about." <br>
                            The three cows wandered into the neighboring field and looked about. There were lots of cars. They had seen people get in and out of them and drive them about. <br>
                            “I want a shot." Baby cow said. <br>
                            “OK son," said Daddy cow (also known as a bull), “You go and see if you can get in one." <br>
                            Baby cow walked around the car-park, he tried the handles of all the cars until he found one that opened. He used his hoof to open the door and crawled into the driver’s seat. <br>
                            “Hey look I’m driving a car," he said as he turned the wheel. “Look." <br>
                            “Very good son," Mummy cow said. “I bet I can get right round the car-park without touching the ground. <br>
                            “How are you going to do that?" Daddy cow (also known as a bull) asked. <br>
                            “By jumping from one car to another." Mummy cow replied. <br>
                            “OK, I’ll time you." <br>
                            “How are you going to do that?" <br>
                            “By counting." <br>
                            Mummy cow walked over to the nearest car. “Ready," she shouted. <br>
                            “On your marks, get set, GO." Then Mummy cow jumped onto the first car and then leaving hoof prints on the bonnet jumped onto the next car leaving a nice cloven-hoofed imprint. She managed to get onto the fifth car before falling onto the ground." <br>
                            “That was fun," she said. “how did I do?" <br>
                            “Three." Replied Daddy cow (also known as a bull). <br>
                            “Three is that all?" <br>
                            “Well yes, I don’t know what comes after three, so that’s all you managed." “Right your turn?" I’ll count for you. <br>
                            So Daddy cow (also known as a bull) jumped onto the first car leaving an even bigger hoof print to the one already there and started jumping from one car to the next. <br>
                            “Hey look this puts some lights on," Baby cow said as he found the lights. Then he found the windscreen wipers. “What are these for?" <br>
                            “They’re in case your windscreen gets muddy." Mummy cow said, forgetting about her counting. “Look I’ll put some mud on them for you." She then proceeded to kick some mud onto the front of the car. The wipers started to squeak and bend as they struggled to wipe away the mud until they broke. <br>
                            “Hey, you’re supposed to be timing me." Daddy cow (also known as a bull) shouted as he slipped off a car. <br>
                            “Three," Mummy cow shouted. “So it’s a draw." <br>
                            “Hey look someone is coming." Baby cow shouted. <br>
                            “Quick scarper, back into our field," Daddy cow (also known as a bull) bellowed. The three cows then ran back into their field. Mummy cow caught the gate with a hoof and pulled it shut just as some people walked back into the car park. <br>
                            The three cows looked at each other and watched as the people walked up and down and scratched their heads. One or two of them looked at the cows and pointed at them and then pointed to the hoof prints on the cars. <br>
                            The three cows just looked back chewing their cud as cows do. <br>
                            “Moo," said Mummy cow. <br>
                            “Moo," replied Baby cow.<br>

                            In a huge pond, there lived many fish. They were arrogant and never listened to anyone. In this pond, there also lived a kind-hearted crocodile. <br>
                            He advised the fish, “It does not pay to be arrogant and overconfident. It could be your downfall." But the fish never listened to him. “There is that crocodile, advising us again," they would say. <br>
                            One afternoon, the crocodile was resting beside a stone near the pond, when two fishermen stopped there to drink water. <br>
                            The fishermen noticed that the pond had many fish. “Look! This pond is full of fish. Let’s come here tomorrow with our fishing net," said one of them. “I am surprised we have not seen this place before!" exclaimed the other. <br>
                            The crocodile heard all this. When the fishermen left, he slowly slipped into the pond and went straight to the fish. “You all had better leave this pond before dawn. Early morning those two fishermen are going to come to this pond with their net," warned the crocodile. <br>
                            But the fish just laughed and said, “There have been many fishermen who have tried to catch us. These two are not going to catch us either. Do not you worry about us, Mr. Crocodile," they said in a mocking voice. <br>
                            The next morning, the fishermen came and threw their net in the pond. The nets were big and strong. Very soon all the fish were caught. “If only we had listened to Mr. Crocodile. He had only wanted to help. For our arrogance we have to pay with our lives," said the fish. <br>
                            The fishermen took the foolish fish to the market and sold them for a good profit.<br>
